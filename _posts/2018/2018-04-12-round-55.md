Thank you [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/buildings/chinatown--washington-DC) for hosting and [Data Society](https://datasociety.com/) for sponsoring!


There were announcements from two meetup friends of Hack and Tell, both worth checking out:

 * [DC Deep Learning Working Group](https://www.meetup.com/DC-Deep-Learning-Working-Group/)
 * [Art + Code Collective](https://www.meetup.com/Art-Code-Collective/)


On to the hacks:


# Drew Mitchell [@drew870mitchell](https://twitter.com/drew870mitchell)

Inspired by Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), using some [torch-rnn code](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn) and personal instant message history, Drew trained his computer to generate text in his voice. It isn't always perfect, but it can be pretty good!

# Aaron Schumacher [@planarrowspace](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace)

Can we simulate [interdimensional cable](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Interdimensional_Cable) by finding truly random YouTube videos? Turns out there _is_ some security by obscurity, which Aaron found out [the hard way](https://github.com/ajschumacher/random_youtube/blob/master/explore.ipynb). Fail fast, they say! You can still [watch pseudo-random YouTube](https://randomyoutube.net/).


# Ali Spittel [@aspittel](https://twitter.com/aspittel)

When you're [learning new things](https://www.alispit.tel/on-learning-new-things/), you might as well write your own custom blogging platform! Why not use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a progressive static site generator for [React](https://reactjs.org/), which uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), among other things? Ali has done all this, and more!


# Nathan Epstein [@Aeium](https://twitter.com/Aeium)

Thanks to Nathan, big games at [The National Go Center](http://nationalgocenter.org/) are now double-gamified: _spectators_ have their own meta-game to play while the matches are [broadcast on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nationalgocenter)! With [go-bet](https://go-bet.herokuapp.com/), observers can chat and place "bets" on where the actual players will move next. It makes the experience way more fun!


# Chris Marciniak

What do you learn when you try to reimplement [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/)'s [Deep Q-Network](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/) reinforcement-learning approach to play [Atari Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) in [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [gym](https://gym.openai.com/)? You learn there are lots of details you have to [get right](https://github.com/marcinic/dqn)!


# Nhi Nguyen

Which pokemon are the same height as you? Or the same weight as you? Now you can find out, by using Nhi's app ([frontend](https://github.com/nnguy152/pokeheiwei-front)/[backend](https://github.com/nnguy152/pokeheiwei-backend)) called PokeHeiWei! The React/[Express](https://expressjs.com/) app accesses data from the pokemon API stored locally in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).


# Aditya Jain [@whaleandpetunia](https://twitter.com/whaleandpetunia)

> On March 31 1939, when John and Ruby Lomax left their vacation home on Port Aransas, Texas, they already had some idea of what they would encounter on their three-month, 6,502 mile journey through the southern United States collecting folk songs

Now, you can experience their journey and the music they found, in Aditya's [Southern Mosaic](https://adityajain15.github.io/lomax/) interactive presentation of [source data](https://www.loc.gov/collections/john-and-ruby-lomax) ([as JSON](https://www.loc.gov/collections/john-and-ruby-lomax?fo=json)) from the Library of Congress.


# Travis Hoppe [@metasemantic](https://twitter.com/metasemantic)

A video is like a cube with two space dimensions and a time dimension. [Timecube](https://thoppe.github.io/timecube/sunset.html) ([code](https://github.com/thoppe/timecube)) lets you watch along a space dimension instead of along time. Turns out to be a fairly non-standard thing to do with video, and requires some tricky processing!
