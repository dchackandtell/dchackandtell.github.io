# Nathan Epstein @Aeium
Convolution Toy. Presented on Tuesday on the art and code collective. Coloring in cellular automations. Using Wolframs rules or other fractals. Take a cellular automation and instead of setting the cell to one, set it to the sum of previous cells. Interpolate colors by using mods of the sums.

# Dan Cardy
Google Home lacked a feature I wanted. So I made it myself. Wanted to fix the sound API from Google Home vs the chromecast. Looked for something online, but nothing did. But google provides and API so I can do it myself! Convert speech to text to interface with Google Home and integrated it with a physical button.

# Clifford Patterson
A generative art project, presenting a summary of the process and then stepping through the code. Described what generative art is -- the artist is the curator. Showed some examples of his generative art. Used Perlin noise. 

# Travis Hoppe - @metasemantic

# Brian Collins
Helping out a friend who is a tour Guide in DC.  He needed some information gathered from the web. Learned that tour guides get $10 every time their name is mentioned. Used beautifulsoup to scrape info for a friend that is a tour guide.

# Aditya Jain - @whaleandpetunia
Visualizing the SF Muni system in realtime.
The bus system (but worse). The map itself is built using a 9MB geo-json file which is too heavy to load. Can reduce the number of coordinates, but Aditya is a map purist -- didn’t want to do that. Can use JS new fetch/async API to create a stream from an ndjson.

Resource on what is/how to work with async/await: https://javascript.info/async
Getting started with [NDJsonStreams](https://canjs.com/doc/can-ndjson-stream.html)

# Andrew Dunkman - @adunkman
DC’s 311 service doesn’t allow looking up service requests without knowing the original requester’s email address. This is problematic for service requests filed via Twitter, since they do not have email addresses — and therefore it’s difficult to lookup their statuses. Not anymore — this side project @dc311rn will now reply to your tweets with a link to check the status.

Twitter bot. 311 is for non-emergency services. Can use it lots of different ways, but Andrew likes to use Twitter. Turns out they give a service request number. There isn’t a good way to look up service request numbers via Twitter requests. Reverse engineered API to get data that was open but hidden.

# Nick Soggin - @codebuddah
Made a Node.js module with the new N-API (non-experimental version).
N-API has a bit of a learning curve, so I thought I'd share my findings :)
