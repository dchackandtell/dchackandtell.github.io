A video is like a cube with two space dimensions and a time dimension. [Timecube](https://thoppe.github.io/timecube/sunset.html) ([code](https://github.com/thoppe/timecube)) lets you watch along a space dimension instead of along time. Turns out to be a fairly non-standard thing to do with video, and requires some tricky processing!
