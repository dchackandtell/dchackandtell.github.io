Thank you [Data Society](https://datasociety.com/) for sponsoring! On to the hacks:

# Rick
Over time, things wear out. His two elbows need a bit of physical therapy. Rick built a prototype assistive device to help him, like a old-fashioned sewing machine that uses a treadle to "load" the device, connected to a c-clamp.

# Chris Nguyen [@uncompiled](https://twitter.com/uncompiled)
Chris made a Wolfenstein 3D-style game, Escape from Prayer Castle, highlighting the absurdity of the predictable "thoughts and prayers" response to gun violence in schools. Instead of weapons, you have your prayer hands. [Link](https://thoughtsandprayers.wtf/)

# Grant Nelson [@grantimus9](https://twitter.com/grantimus9)
Grant hacked Stripe and was paid a $1500 bug bounty. If Stripe has already seen your email address, it asks for a two-factor authentication code, and the verification API would produce an error when the email address was associated with a phone number. Enabled an email -> phone number translator for Stripe accounts.

# Grant Harper [@grant_emersn](https://twitter.com/grant_emersn)
The other Grant built an Alexa App to keep copies of your recipes by ingredient and title. [Link](https://recipes.theaudiochef.com)

# Adam Specker & Michael
Adam and Michael created a Star Wars themed attractiveness-rating riffing off the old "Hot or Not" website. Someone found a vulnerability and stuffed the ballot box in favor of Jar Jar Binks. [Link](http://hoth-or-not.herokuapp.com/) / [Source](https://github.com/aspecker/Hoth-or-not)

# Nathan Epstein [@Aeium](https://twitter.com/Aeium)
Nathan built a hypnotic spirograph in Javascript. [Link](https://aeium.github.io/spiralToy/?x1=402&y1=287&x2=405&y2=285) / [First version](https://aeium.github.io/spiralToy/) / [Waypoint path version](https://aeium.github.io/spiralCommander/) How do you measure the geometric complexity? A rough way to do this is with PNG file size. [Source](https://github.com/Aeium/spiralToy)

# Aaron Schumacher [@planarrowspace](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace)
Aaron won the World Championship at [Texata](http://www.texata.com/), the "big data analytics showdown," and talked about the GDELT data set: a big scraping of all world events. Like 100 GB! He demoed the usage of some high powered EC instances with a custom map-reduce in Python.

# Daniel Henneberger
Daniel used a DIY CRISPR Kit to build some fluorescent yeast. [Link](https://github.com/henneberger/EngineeredBeer)

# James Reichard
An app to visualize rhythmic patterns and Euclidean Rhythms. [Link](https://superbuggy.github.io/euclidean-rhythm-visualizer/) / [Source](https://github.com/superbuggy/euclidean-rhythm-visualizer) / [Further reading](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/music-and-memory)

# Jess Garson [@jessicagarson](https://twitter.com/jessicagarson)
Messica Arson did a live DJ set with Haskell and SonicPi. [Link](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/DJMessicaArson)
