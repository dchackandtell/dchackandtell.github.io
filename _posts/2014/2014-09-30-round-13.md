[Round 12](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/204722772/) was the very last day of September, and everyone was [there](http://dc.hackandtell.org/), [except](https://twitter.com/MuttBadley/status/514924258854981632) for [Mutt Badley](https://twitter.com/MuttBadley). [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) provided the order of awesomeness:


**Speaker 1 - [Andrew T. Baker](https://twitter.com/andrewtorkbaker)**

Andrew went all [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on his [funemployment](http://andrewtorkbaker.com/funemployment), and combined [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/stream), [Instagram Hyperlapse](http://blog.instagram.com/post/95829278497/hyperlapse-from-instagram), and some [map thing](http://datamaps.github.io/) all up by the API-strings into [Hypermasher](http://www.hypermasher.com/hyperlapse). Whoa. [Tycho-tastic](http://tychomusic.com/). (Andrew promises code Real Soon Now!)


**Speakers 2 - [Rachel Shorey](https://twitter.com/rachel_shorey), [Regina Lam](https://twitter.com/ReginaLamRL), [Anupama Pillalamarri](https://twitter.com/iamtheanupama)**

It started at the [Tech Lady Hackathon](http://techladyhackathon.org/), drew an army of woman coders, many from [Hear Me Code](http://hearmecode.com/), and [Code for Progress](http://www.codeforprogress.org/) coordinated with the state of Maryland, to bring the world: [Buscando Maryland](http://buscandomaryland.com/). It's [about](http://buscandomaryland.com/about/) helping children seeking refuge from violence in Central America, and the [code](https://github.com/aliyarahman/buscando) is all up on github!
