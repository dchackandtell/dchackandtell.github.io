[Round 14](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/210034052/) brought [DC Hack and Tell](http://dc.hackandtell.org/) to whole new levels of awesomeness. We [saw, heard, and partied](http://www.seehearparty.com/) in celebration of the inimitable [Shannon](https://twitter.com/svt827) joining DC H&T as an official [organizer](https://twitter.com/svt827/status/529415870028992512). We welcomed a [code of conduct](https://github.com/dchackandtell/code-of-conduct) of superb pedigree (may we always be excellent to one another). And there were super cool projects!


**Speaker 0 - [Aaron](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace)**

Aaron built a [static](https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/) [blog](http://planspace.org/) pulling in [previous](http://planspace.blogspot.com/) [blog](https://planspacedotorg.wordpress.com/) XML data and allowing for parallel [big slides](http://www.macwright.org/big/) with some [konami](http://code.snaptortoise.com/konami-js/) code [magic](http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake/).


**Speaker 1 - [Joe](https://twitter.com/josephmosby)**

Joe built a way for a remote staff member to turn lights on / off in HQ to get attention of staff. And there are [slides](http://josephmosby.com/presentations/raspberry_pi/)! And a [repo](https://github.com/APCO-Worldwide/operation-sardine)!


**Speaker 2 - [Leah B.](https://twitter.com/leahbannon)**

Leah built a tool to help provide transparency in government services, akin to [gov.uk/transformation](https://www.gov.uk/transformation). (Apparently they are awesome & we should all be like these individuals). The equivalent FOR THE UNITED STATES is [online](http://18f.github.io/dashboard) and [open source](https://github.com/18F/dashboard). Go [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)!


**Speaker 3 - [Shannon](https://twitter.com/svt827)**

Shannon made a site to showcase universities that are hiding the degree of sexual assault that is occurring on their campuses. Given the likelihood of sexual cases actually being 0 is remote, they are more than likely simply not reporting actual numbers. Data is from the Washington Post; over 500 schools reported 0 occurrences over a *three year period*. And now you can [see it on a map](http://shannonvturner.com/seriously/), and also [see the source](https://github.com/shannonturner/seriously).


**Speaker 4 - [Morgana](https://twitter.com/_oneunit)**

Morgana built an app to solve: "If there is a Nats game, how soon do I have to leave my house? And if there is not a Nats game, what are my alternatives?" (In [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).) Python source [on github](https://github.com/morganacarter/Ferris_Bueller). More APIs than you can shake a [bat](https://twitter.com/_oneunit/status/529365718798966784) at.


**Speaker 5 - [Mot](https://twitter.com/motdotla)**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motdotla/historysniff/master/historysniff.gif)

(Thanks [RebelMail](http://rebelmail.com/) for bringing Mot to our coast!) Mot made a JavaScript library called [historysniff](https://github.com/motdotla/historysniff) to deduce a visitors' browser history from a manifest file of websites. Uses a hacky approach based on asset load time (cached vs uncached). Looks for specific assets in cache to see if they were at a site recently.


**Speaker 6 - [Brian](https://twitter.com/bfrickert)**

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1jvt4rCcAAbxZF.jpg)

*UFOs: Implausible Deniability?* Brian used [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for scraping [UFO data](http://www.nuforc.org/), and applied a slew of visualizations and algorithms to it. For the hilarious results... you really had to be there.


**Speaker 7 - [Leah L.](https://twitter.com/LeahLibresco)**

Leah built Arduino-controlled [light gauntlets for Halloween](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2014/11/happy-halloween-from-the-sun-summoner.html) to be [Alina Starkov](http://shadowandbone.wikia.com/wiki/Alina_Starkov). And you can build your own, thanks to her [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) write-up, [Accelerometer Controlled Light Gauntlets](http://www.instructables.com/id/Accelerometer-Controlled-Light-Gauntlets/)! (If you only have six seconds, you can check it out [on vine](https://vine.co/v/OM3d5wuqPah).)


**Speaker 8 - [Chris](https://twitter.com/cmgiven)**

Chris made an [open source](https://github.com/cmgiven/open-election-map) election results map for the DC mayoral and marijuana legalization votes. It uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for mapping. The election waited for no one! The live site ran at [electionmap.wamu.org](http://electionmap.wamu.org/) ([github.io link](http://cmgiven.github.io/open-election-map/)) Starting to think Chris can't stop making cool web maps all the time...
