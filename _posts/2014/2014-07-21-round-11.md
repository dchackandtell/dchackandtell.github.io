Jonathan ([@jon_m_rod](https://twitter.com/jon_m_rod)) talked about turning Fitbit data into useful personal data for free and not having to pay fitbit for personalized reports. He used, [Knitr (R package)](http://yihui.name/knitr) this lets you make cool PDF reports. In future potentially adding [Shiny package](http://www.r-bloggers.com/dynamic-data-visualizations-in-the-browser-using-shiny/) for visualization in a web interface. 

**Speaker 2 - Jay Kay**

Jay (@BeerLabryrinth) showcased an awesome stack of 4 [Nvidia Jetson Tegra K1](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-tk1)s which have all kinds of [cool applications](http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/low-power-sensing-autonomy-nvidia-jetson-tk1/). It ammounts to over 500 cores costing $600 that is 2lb in a 6x6" package. Damn. He vehmently denies that he's using 192 GPUs to call aliens / mine bitcoin.

**Speaker 3 - Shannon Turner**

Shannon ([@svt827](https://twitter.com/svt827)) showed a new website she had built called "[Shut that down](http://Shutthatdown.com)". It showcases heinous quotes that politicians say paired to  campaign donations. You can then directly tweet the details to showcase the fact that organizations are supporting these individuals with questionable perspectives.  The project ([source](https://github.com/shannonturner/shut-that-down)) pulls data from [sunlight foundation influence API ](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/04/06/influence-data-apis/). The idea was that something like this might provoke change by making organizations think twice about supporting organizations that donate to these individuals. It was "For fun. And vengeance."

**Speaker 4 - Ed Summers**

Ed ([@edsu](https://twitter.com/edsu)) built an app that tweets to [@congressedits](https://mobile.twitter.com/congressedits) whenever congress changes wikipedia. Based off an initial app in the UK that used IFFT, he built an [open source version](http://github.com/edsu/anon) that has since spread to a variety of other [countries / general twitter bots based on the same idea](https://twitter.com/congressedits/following). It has hit over 21K followers and more details can be found in the [slides](https://edsu.github.io/congressedits-slides/#/).

**Speaker 5 - Reed Spool**

Reed showcased some fun things you can do with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), Node.js and the [Golden ratio](http://codepen.io/reedspool/details/lukHL/).[Github.com/reedspool](https://github.com/reedspool). Yay for fractal / recursive things.
