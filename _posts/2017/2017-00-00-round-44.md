Serverless Data Parsing

Creates an AWS Lambda function for you quickly and easily to do your data parsing, even if you don't know how to set up the AWS Lambda.

Toughest part is having to figure out how to package all of the dependencies together since with Lambda functions you have to include everything.

Python package that runs functions like grok and logstash, then has a runs an

Uses Apache NiFi -- created in-house at the NSA and open-sourced. An ETL (extract, transform, load) program.

Limitation on number of concurrent AWS Lambda functions running at any time or how much memory is allocated, so you have to be careful with how much data you're processing at any time.

Make Voldemort Great Again

[https://github.com/uncompiled/voldemort](https://github.com/uncompiled/voldemort)

machinebox.io -- machine learning API inside a docker container, so you don't need to know machine learning

It only knows what you teach it, so Chris taught it what voldemort looks like.

You can then upload an image, it will find the image of Donald Trump, and photoshop Voldemort's face on top of Trump's face

Live demo worked with the family photo!

Platform for open source collaboration on projects that are not code.

GitHub is super confusing for non-coder contributors, so is there a better, alternative platform?

An idea:

Google groups as front end for communications; cloud storage like Google Drive for documents, spreadsheets, project management

Problem: version/revision control is not as sophisticated as git, though Google Drive has track changes

How do you incentivize participation and open-source collaboration?

Maybe: use a Wiki?

Python and the LED bulb API

[https://github.com/alecdhuse/lifx-python/blob/master/demo.py](https://github.com/alecdhuse/lifx-python/blob/master/demo.py)

Lifx light bulb, works via Android / iOS App -- turn on/off, change colors, cycle

It's a WiFi-connected light bulb!

Cool: You can simulate a sunrise and set it up over a cronjob to wake you up!

One bulb is like $50!

Stupid TensorFlow Tricks: The Thomson Problem 

[https://medium.com/towards-data-science/stupid-tensorflow-tricks-3a837194b7a0](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/stupid-tensorflow-tricks-3a837194b7a0)

TensorFlow is open source library for deep learning

The Thomson problem is a difficult challenge where you uniformly distribute many points across a sphere -- easy at small N, very challenging at large N.

I made a wearable sensor that can track your movements while you wear it. I'll demo the device and talk about the process I went through to make it.
