In high school, a friend loaned me all her R.E.M. tapes. They were lovingly dubbed, with her rendition of the cover art and everything. I dubbed those, so my copy of a copy was a little warbly (and lacked cover art). My walkperson had a 'record' button, which I would accidentally hit all the time while biking through Rock Creek park, so there are certain song that I only knew with holes in them. "This one goe t to the one I ve". I'd eventually get a copy of these albums in straight-to-MP3 format---no warble, no sudden gaps---and they felt wrong to me.
 
Wearin monitors your system for open MP3s and inserts glitches by flipping random bytes in the file. As you play the files more, they wear in more and become yours.
