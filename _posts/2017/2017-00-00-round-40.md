Set by DJ Messica Arson using Sonic Pi 

Audience spent 5 minutes mesmerized by Jess' live-coding DJ set. Code was done in Ruby using Sonic Pi.  She ran it on her laptop, but it can also be run on a Raspberry Pi.

I will present how I ran spontaneous poetry booths (with an old Smith Corona typewriter) at festivals and how Chick fil A hired me to write poetry for its events. My poetry has unique form, rhymes, and can be written quickly.

Dave ran a 5 minute training session on how to make money and get free things by writing poetry. He's received granola bars, rope, and even a coffee maker by writing poetry in emails to various companies. He took it to another level with his spontaneous poetry booth, where he met with customers for a few minutes and wrote a personalized poem for each one.

Sexist twitter feedback following tweets about my Women Data Scientists talk about gender bias and the presidential candidates. Is that irony?
