I wanted to make a choropleth map visualization using Leaflet, like

[leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html](leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html)

and my data is stored on Dropbox. So I created a Postgres database with the PostGIS extension using Amazon web services RDS and use the python dropbox sdk + psycopg2 library (postgres integration) to load it up with the data from my Dropbox. Then I created an AWS ubuntu instance to host a website. The webpage runs some php code to query the database, and apply any filters specified by the users. Then it uses Leaflet to draw the choropleth polygon boundaries (which are returned from the database as geojson) and uses the data to color each polygon appropriately.

Took advantage of lack of digital security at a scientific conference to add comedy to the twitter feed of the front page of the conference.  Attempted to get as many followers as possible and get them in on the comedy as well.
