# [Jess B.](https://twitter.com/SirJesstheBrave) and [Seth P](https://twitter.com/sethpuckett): Game of Thones Death Pool Leaderboard

Made an app so their friends could all vote for who they thought would die in the next Game of Thrones.
Get points based on whether you guessed right, and how right you were.
Uses tabletop.js to read data from a spreadsheet, and made an app in angular to visualize it.

Check it out!

# [Tom](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine): Horetu 

horetu turns a Python function into a command-line program with a command-line argument parser and an optional configuration file parser. It accepts configurations from the command line, falls back to the configuration file if it exists, and then falls back to any defaults that are set in the Python function.

Tom uses a Dvorak keyboard.

While this might seem appropriate for absolutely any Python program, I recommend against using it at work because it is too easy and good.

# [Kate Rabinowitz](https://twitter.com/DataLensDC), Visualizing the DC Brewery Boom

Beer's becoming a big thing in DC apparently, and Kate wanted to see how the beer scene here compared to other parts of the country.

She found beeradvocate.com, a website that reviews beers. She emailed them to see if she could scrape data from their website, and well that was a bust. Darn.

In Python, uses selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from (put in website name here). Saved this data to a CSV, then used R to parse it and make some graphs.

DC ranks 9th among East Coast cities for local brews, above Boston and Philadelphia.

# [Ben Klemens](https://twitter.com/b__k), Taxes flow chart

Ben created an interactive flow chart, written in d3, that helps you do your taxes. Type in your wages, student loan information, etc. and watch as the tax form information is filled out. Uses dagger library to generate pretty graphs.

# [Rushi Shah](https://twitter.com/2016rshah), Comet

He created a library called Comet that can grab the latest commit for a Github repo so that you can display the commit message on a website.

Code was written in Elixir, a popular functional programming language for webservers. Used tentacat library to grab github commit messages.

# [Anna Petrone](https://twitter.com/ampetr89), AWS routing engine

Used AWS and PostgreSQL to make her own routing engine. She hosted her tool on Amazon web service. To put it together, she installed Postgres on a regular EC2 instance. She downloaded a bunch of OpenStreetMap data for DC, and converted this data into a SQL database.

Uses [pgRouting library](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting) and Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal routes.

# [Sean Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/SeanMGonzalez), Survey System

"Survey System" for gathering information at events. It is a set of bluetooth buttons inside 3D printed buttons (KrishCorp) that assemble like legos or puzzle pieces to arrange as 1x2, 1x3, 1x5, 2x2, 3x3, etc. The question is displayed next to the buttons and each button corresponds to a pre-determined answer. The system currently writes to a google doc, and the Shiny App pulls from those google docs to display in a simple bar chart. Designed for Data Community DC.

Why do this? The ultimate goal was to solve the challenge of ROI for sponsors at events, like Hack & Tell! Sponsors want to know there is value in paying for their advertisement, and a slide and announcement at the beginning of an event has very little effect towards driving people to do something online. To show ROI, we can:
+ Answer critical questions
+ Draw attention to some content

To gather answer critical questions for the sponsor, we could ask everyone at an event, "Does your employer reimburse for online courses?"
To draw attention to some content, we could display that content clearly next to the buttons and ask a question about that content, such as, "Which of these courses is most relevant to your job?"
In the end, we're doing things like this, or DATAble, to make sponsorship and thereby organizing easier, building the community so we can have more Hack & Tells :)

# [Jessica Garson](https://twitter.com/jessicagarson )

Jessica made a website using Flask to host her computer programming Zine "What's My Function". She says she hasn't used it before, but apparently Flask is so awesome that she was able to put together a great website in less than a day.

Is AWS punk?

Relatively punk, I think

# [Travis Hoppe]((https://twitter.com/metasemantic),  arXiv2git

Problem: papers are published to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), but they put their code on github, and a new researcher comes along and can't find one or the other.

[Check it out on the Chome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arxiv2git/gfhbipbocjiapodeflmklgnnnndplnpp/related?hl=en)

Travis made a tool, arXiv2git, as a chrome extension that aims to fix this problem. 
He scraped a bunch of github repositories and looked for arXiv links in their code and descriptions. 
When you go to the arXiv website and are on the page for a given paper, his extension will look through these descriptions and will print out a list of potential github matches at the bottom of the webpage.
