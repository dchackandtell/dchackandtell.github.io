# Speaker 1: [Travis Hoppe](https://github.com/thoppe)

**today-AI-learned**

`todayAIlearned` is an attempt to mine Wikipedia for interesting things!

Supervised machine learning requires a massive tagged collection of high-quality data to be effective. 
Fortunately the past submissions of to [r/TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) have done just that.

Reddit's Today I Learned: a collection of facts that other people have found interesting. Data Collection, Downloaded all popular posts with high score that are from Wikipedia. Tokenize words & do data cleansing & used Google Word2Vec: training classifier for the words.

Ended up with a true positive rate of 10%, but a true negative rate of 99.8%, meaning we can find interesting things without too much work!

# Speaker 2: Ben Klamens

**POSIX Shell Scripting to draw card images**

Ben designed a complicated series of shell scripts to creates pictures for an upcoming card game **_Bamboo Harvest._**

Designed the card game to be a geometric, resource-building game; taking the game to Gen Con to demo it. 

Use pipes to concatenate image blocks together.

Lot's of companies exist to print the cards if you're interested (ex. [printandplay](http://www.printplaygames.com/)).

# Speaker 3: [Jess Garson](https://github.com/JessicaGarson)

**Movie sentiment scores**

Code lives at [https://github.com/JessicaGarson/MovieSentiment](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/MovieSentiment)

Jess shows off her attempts to predict a sentiment score of how positive or negative a movie review is using a [Rotton Tomato](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/) review.
This is quite challenging, since Rotten Tomatoes ratings are often very sarcastic ... something machines don't handle very well.

The project was inspired by a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) contest, great way to start Machine Learning!

Used Logistic Regression and experimented with other classifiers.
Used Google's [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) a deep learning tool to figure out the meaning of a word, though it didn't work as well as expected.

Jess wants everyone to come to **[Machine learning Fridays](http://machinelearningfridays.splashthat.com/)** for more awesome projects like this!

# Speaker 4: Reed Spool

**A Simple Stack Based Programming Language**

> "Why the hell aren't we writing programming languages all the time, aren't they so much fun[!?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang)"

Reed wanted to teach us a programming language in the scant five minutes we allotted. 

A simple post-fix notation language that went something like this:

1. Parse token
2. Add value to the stack
3. If operands, take values of the stack and compute

Project started by trying prove a point that I could write a programming language in 15 minutes.

Supporting more than one level of parentheses is really challenging since they could be composed within one another; postfix notation doesn't support this. So this project doesn't support any parentheses.


[An example](http://codepen.io/reedspool/pen/JoEOoK?editors=001) of a Simple Stack Based Langauge that he wrote before.

A URL programming language: [http://concatinative.herokuapp.com/exec/20%2030%20+](http://concatinative.herokuapp.com/exec/20%2030%20+)

# Speaker 5: Alec Dhuse

**Printable guides for Rock Climbing**

Demo at [http://topohawk.com/print/Northwest-Branch](http://topohawk.com/print/Northwest-Branch)

Alec is a rock climber, and wants to provide a printable tool for other like-minded individuals.

Why not use a phone app? "Good idea to have paper and not a phone when climbing in RL". Seems obvious enough.

His program creates up-to-date guidebook for destinations automagically and loads data from his custom database.
Creates maps using [`Leaflet.js`](http://leafletjs.com/), adds information until it runs out of room on the page.

Arranges pages in a way so that you can print and fold the paper into a booklet.
Learned to use `@media` CSS setting to handle special print options.
Chrome respects the printing CSS rules the best.
