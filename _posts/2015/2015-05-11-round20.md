Reddit's Today I Learned: a collection of facts that other people have found interesting. Data Collection, Downloaded all popular posts with high score that are from Wikipedia

Compare to Wikipedia

Tokenize words & do data cleansing & used Google Word2Vec: training classifier for the words.

Trying to create machine learning to determine whether something is interesting.

Ended up with a true positive rate of 10%.

**POSIX Shell Scripting to draw card images**

Saves time 

Creates pictures for the game **_Bamboo Harvest._**

Designed the card game to be a geometric, resource-building game; taking the game to Gen Con to demo it. 

Use pipes to concatenate image blocks together.

Lot's of companies exist to print the cards ([printandplay](http://www.printplaygames.com/), and some other company, game scripter?)

**Movie sentiment scores**

Code lives at [https://github.com/JessicaGarson/MovieSentiment](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/MovieSentiment)

Movie sentiment score, learned on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Starts with a Rotten Tomato movie review.

Predict a sentiment score of how positive or negative a Rotten Tomato score, but this was challenging since Rotten Tomatoes ratings are often very sarcastic, which can throw it off.

Several tries:

Logistic Regression and others ... 

Using Google's [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/): Uses deep learning to figure out the meaning of a word,

# Speaker 4: Reed Spool

**A Simple Stack Based Programming Language**

I want to teach you a programming language in five minutes. Post-fix notation.

1. Parsing (tokenization) 
2. Add values to the stack
3. Operands are take values of the stack

"Concatenative stack-based language"

Why the hell aren't we writing programming languages all the time, they are so fun!?

Supporting more than one level of parentheses is really challenging since they could be composed within one another; postfix notation doesn't support this. So this project doesn't support any parentheses.

Trying to prove a point that I could write a programming language in 15 minutes.

[Example](http://codepen.io/reedspool/pen/JoEOoK?editors=001) Simple Stack Based Langauge.

URL programming language: [http://concatinative.herokuapp.com/exec/20%2030%20+](http://concatinative.herokuapp.com/exec/20%2030%20+)

**Printable guides for Rock Climbing**

Demo at [http://topohawk.com/print/Northwest-Branch](http://topohawk.com/print/Northwest-Branch)

Rock climber

Creates up-to-date guidebook for destinations automagically. Loads data from my custom database.

Creates maps using Leaflet.js, adds information until it runs out of room on the page.

Arranges pages in a way so that you can print and fold the paper into a booklet.

Uses @media CSS setting to handle special print options.

Chrome respects the printing CSS rules the best.

Inspired by [http://alpha.drtopo.com/](http://alpha.drtopo.com/)

Good idea to have paper and not a phone when climbing in RL.
