**Trump!**

When are we are real selves?
Pew Research, call people and get context for various opinions
"mode effects", sample bias?

XBOX live -- shows different people prefs vary
HuffPollster API - gives info on Trump, nice API wrappers for many languages

Trump is liked in non-interviews but not as much when there is a real person. This doesn't show up for Carson & Fiona. Super interesting!

Project: github.com/tmc/openfec
Docs: godoc.org/github.com/tmc/openfec
FEC publishes data on campaign. Wrote a Go client package API to access the data from https://api.open.fec.gov/developers.
For example can pull a list of all POTUS candidates.

Go was released in '05 by Google. Designed by former Bell Labs researchers. Writes almost expressively as python but doesn't turn into mush at the end! Free test framework and coverage (and {cpu,block,heap} profiling).

Presentation on Guerrilla government
The slides are at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0fUKRnu1oAhRERxNmIyWkVHZnM/view?usp=sharing 
Action of a government agent outside of supervisors wishes BUT is related.
Is it looked at as a problem? Should we fire them or promote them? David thinks this is how real shit gets done. E.g. how to be a better guerilla, four things
Side projects (Hack and Tell etc) 
Hacks -- doing work contrary to official procedures
Cuff systems -- IT that exists outside, examples? Everywhere. Shadow IT. 
Intrapreneurs -- does something innovatative even when breaking the rules inside the system

How to incorporate it? Facts on the ground. JUST DO IT. and show it's easier.
There is a conference coming up!

Orthographic Pedant - spell check the internet...or maybe just GitHub
Lars, the orthographic pedant is sending many a pull request. Almost 3000 in fact.
Before getting shut down.

How are we doing as a nation for registering as an organ donor? Hack at Columbia data science event
Big outliers in states like Montana. Why? 
Does having more DMV locations help... seems to be no real correlation?

Found that life center northwest a group that engages the public helps a lot. Also public service announcements & commercials.  
Q: The american life looked at this...
http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/02/21/280759139/for-more-organ-donors-just-head-to-the-local-dmv

Q: Opt-in, vs opt-out

This really needs to be a study... but some organizations don't have a Facebook account and there aren't reliable metrics.

There was a good book about what drives donation rates, called Last Best Gifts: http://www.amazon.com/Last-Best-Gifts-Altruism-Market/dp/0226322378

Loves data and loves the district. Looked at how DC spends vs other cities. 

B. of Labor and Stats has a crazy level of detail describing everything we spend -- including cereal.

Plotted eating in vs average expenditure. DC is on the bottom -- we don't like to spend money eating out/dress/or fashion, but we like books and cars.
