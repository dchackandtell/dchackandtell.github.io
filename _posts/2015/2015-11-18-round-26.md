Here are the Hackpad presentation notes from [Round 26: The Curious Camaraderie of Code](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/220231793/).

# [Benjamin Robinson](https://github.com/benjaminrobinson)

 
race to the top:
Website that displays data for report card in DC, [http://learndc.org/](http://learndc.org/).

The hack connects the nice raw data to a tool to help people develop the data, an API. That is pretty. Developed an R package.

The data needs to be wrangled, for example bl7, black African american.

# Steve Trickey
_Hack your brain for the dopamine rushes!_

 Exercise hack! Genetic disposition for exercise!?

Fitbit lies! OR at least doesn't give all the data.
Broke my fitbit and it died... :(
Built a wearable ... Arduino Uno R3 with a GPS logger and other parts -- put it all in a fanny pack. 

What's next? Nicer plots and commute data!
Anyone have experience plotting GPS tracks? Can you recommend tools/frameworks/libraries?

# Harlan Harris, [@harlanh](https://twitter.com/harlanh)
  
Promo for Data Science DC. (http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-DC/)
  
Meta talk about meetups themselves! 

Plots the data from meetup that shows the RSVP and headcounts automatically (for groups that enter their headcount).  

More data there in the future: event data, each member, their cross-group joins and their public posts.

# Jan Domanski
A simple meta-analysis exercise
  
Meta-analysis, example of aggregation of scientific reports.
[http://www.labstep.com/](http://www.labstep.com/)

Plot of all things that kill cells, so we can see what the aggregate data is.

How to build a laser blaster, with LED's but not lasers. :(
Idea: I wanted to make myself into a robot for Halloween.
Showing off a laser blaster arm, but not the drill arm :)

The circuit is online.
Full of simple components, voltage divider. resistor capacitor circuit

# [Jim Webb](https://twitter.com/jimwebb)
  
Web developer, not a hardware hacker or EE major, @jimwebb
But... built a piece of hardware that uses infrared to detect blinks, typical blink 100-400 ms. 
Arduino with IR sensor to do something when you blink.

Wrote a webpage that reads the blink readings and changes color, also changes pictures.
Change image with a blink of an eye.

Shows the Hoff' during a blink.
Play flappy bird with blinking.

# rektide
  
Built a bike with 30 lbs of speakers
speakers, amp, batteries
 
100 volts between his legs. Used velcro so he didn't die. Parts and pieces were pretty simple. Old version setup time 1 hour. 

New and improved version 15 min setup!
Played some awesome tune w/the bike for us.
  
Chromecast audio, Raspberry Pi, Mopidy
Check out DC Bike Party on Facebook
Noted: lithium polymer batteries explode.

# [John Kaufhold](http://www.deeplearninganalytics.com/)
  
Jetson TK1
NVIDIA processor, 192 core graphics card.
Small device built -- case built for a project.
Learned that he can put it in a sandwich box. 
Deep learning device, mobile. Trying to get sensor data into deep learning data decisions.

# Travis Hoppe, [@metasemantic](https://twitter.com/metasemantic)
_Bro do you even science?_
  
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
char-rnn (Andrej Karpathy): Lua/torch library to implement RNN-LSTM
https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn

arXiv.org: downloaded everything because that's what Travis does ;)
Machine Learning: trained all categories on the same set of hyperparameters
Generated fake article titles: scientists couldn't figure out which were real!

# Merav Yuravlivker, [@merav_yurav](https://twitter.com/merav_yurav)
 
First hack and tell. :)
Suicide attacks in Paris, WaPo had a static visualization. Built a visualization using R and Shiny, bar charts and a choropleth.  

Raw data source from University of Chicago, [cpostdata](http://cpostdata.uchicago.edu/search_new.php).
