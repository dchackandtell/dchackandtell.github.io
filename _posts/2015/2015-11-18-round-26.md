HACKPAD BELOW

Monday Nov 16

Benjamin
race to the top:
Website that displays data for report card in DC, 
http://learndc.org/

The hack connects the nice raw data to a tool to help people develop the data, an API. That is pretty. Developed an R package.

Code live at: Created package on github
https://github.com/benjaminrobinson/LearnDC
 
The data needs to be wrangled, for example bl7, black African american. 

Steve Trickey
 Exercise hack! Genetic disposition for exercise!?
 It's hard work man! Hack your brain for the dopamine rushes!  

Fitbit lies! OR at least doesn't give all the data.
Broke my fitbit and it died... :(
Built a wearable ... Arduino Uno R3 with a GPS logger and other parts -- put it all in a fanny pack.

Blog post: http://onceknewatechnohacker.blogspot.com/
What's next? Nicer plots and commute data!
Anyone have experience plotting GPS tracks? Can you recommend tools/frameworks/libraries?

Harlan Harris
@harlanh on Twitter
Promo for Data Science DC. (http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-DC/)
Meta talk about meetups themselves! 
Shiny App: https://harlanh.shinyapps.io/shiny-meetup-stats
GitHub: https://github.com/HarlanH/shiny-meetup-stats
Plots the data from meetup that shows the RSVP and headcounts automatically (for groups that enter their headcount).  

More data there in the future: event data, each member, their cross-group joins and their public posts.

Jan Domanski
A simple meta-analysis exercise
Meta-analysis, example of aggregation of scientific reports.
http://www.labstep.com/

Plot of all things that kill cells, so we can see what the aggregate data is.
  
Eric H
How to build a laser blaster, with LED's but not lasers. :(
Idea: I wanted to make myself into a robot for Halloween.
Showing off a laser blaster arm, but not the drill arm :)

The circuit is online.
Full of simple components, voltage divider. resistor capacitor circuit

Jim Webb
Web developer, not a hardware hacker or EE major, @jimwebb
But... built a piece of hardware that uses infrared to detect blinks, typical blink 100-400 ms. 
Arduino with IR sensor to do something when you blink.

Wrote a webpage that reads the blink readings and changes color, also changes pictures.
Change image with a blink of an eye

Shows the Hoff' during a blink.
Play flappy bird with blinking

rektide
Built a bike with 30 lbs of speakers
speakers, amp, batteries
 
100 volts between his legs. Used velcro so he didn't die. Parts and pieces were pretty simple. Old version setup time 1 hour. 

New and improved version 15 min setup!
.Played some awesome tune w/the bike for us.
Chromecast audio, Raspberry Pi, Mopidy
Check out DC Bike Party on Facebook
Noted: lithium polymer batteries explode.

John K
Jetson TK1
NVIDIA processor, 192 core graphics card.
Small device built -- case built for a project.
Learned that he can put it in a sandwich box. 
Deep learning device, mobile. Trying to get sensor data into deep learning data decisions.      

Travis Hoppe
Bro do you even science?
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
char-rnn (Andrej Karpathy): Lua/torch library to implement RNN-LSTM
https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn

arXiv.org: downloaded everything because that's what Travis does ;)
Machine Learning: trained all categories on the same set of hyperparameters
Generated fake article titles: scientists couldn't figure out which were real!

Merav Yuravlivker
First hack and tell. :)
Suicide attacks in Paris, WaPo had a static visualization. Built a visualization using R and Shiny, bar charts and a choropleth.

# Jonathan Robinson, [@jon_m_rob](https://twitter.com/jon_m_rob)
_Trump! Are you Trolling Me?_

Jonathan dared to ask the question, when are we are real selves? 
It turns out that the answer depends on who is asking the question. 
Jonathan took data from the Pew Research Center -- an organization that calls people to get context for various opinions.
He found that there were significant [mode effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_effect) on America's new GOP sweetheart, Mr. Trump. 

He used the HuffPollster API to show that Trump is liked in non-interviews but not as much when there is a real person on the line. This doesn't show up for Carson or Fiorina. Why are people afraid to admit they like Trump? 
Super interesting!
