Here are the Hackpad presentation notes from [Round 26: The Curious Camaraderie of Code](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/220231793/).

# Benjamin Robinson, [github/benjaminrobinson](https://github.com/benjaminrobinson)
_beautiful report cards for schools_

Benjamin is part of a team that develops report cards for schools around DC. Man are they pretty, [http://learndc.org/](http://learndc.org/).
Benjamin however, wanted the data to be more acceiable and develop more applications, so he wrote an R package that connects to their API.

Comments: The data still needs to be wrangled and much works needs to be done (for example what does BL7 mean?).

# Steve Trickey
_hack your brain for the dopamine rushes!_

Fitbit lies! .... or at least doesn't give all the data.
Steve thinks he lacks the genetic disposition for exercise, so he needed to hack his brain.
The day his fitbit and it died he started working on a device, an Arduino Uno R3 with a GPS logger and other parts -- and put the whole thing in a fanny pack.
 Now he has all the data! 

What's next? Nicer plots and commute data!

Q from Steve: Anyone have experience plotting GPS tracks? Can you recommend tools/frameworks/libraries? If you can, contact him!

# Harlan Harris, [@harlanh](https://twitter.com/harlanh)
_meta-meetup madness!_
  
Promo for Data Science DC. (http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-DC/)
  
Meta talk about meetups themselves! 

Plots the data from meetup that shows the RSVP and headcounts automatically (for groups that enter their headcount).  

More data there in the future: event data, each member, their cross-group joins and their public posts.

# Jan Domanski
_aggregating scientific reports for dummies_
  
A simple meta-analysis exercise
  
Meta-analysis, example of aggregation of scientific reports.
[http://www.labstep.com/](http://www.labstep.com/)

Plot of all things that kill cells, so we can see what the aggregate data is.

# Eric Haengel, [github/ehaengel](https://github.com/ehaengel)
_laser robot blaster arms (need we say more?)_
  
How to build a laser blaster, with LED's but not lasers. :(
Idea: I wanted to make myself into a robot for Halloween.
Showing off a laser blaster arm, but not the drill arm :)

The circuit is online.
Full of simple components, voltage divider. resistor capacitor circuit

# Jim Webb, [@jimwebb](https://twitter.com/jimwebb)
_don't blink_
  
Web developer, not a hardware hacker or EE major, @jimwebb
But... built a piece of hardware that uses infrared to detect blinks, typical blink 100-400 ms. 
Arduino with IR sensor to do something when you blink.

Wrote a webpage that reads the blink readings and changes color, also changes pictures.
Change image with a blink of an eye.

Shows the Hoff' during a blink.
Play flappy bird with blinking.

# rektide
_A man who values music distribution over his safety. Is he the hero we need?_
  
Built a bike with 30 lbs of speakers
speakers, amp, batteries
 
100 volts between his legs. Used velcro so he didn't die. Parts and pieces were pretty simple. Old version setup time 1 hour. 

New and improved version 15 min setup!
Played some awesome tune w/the bike for us.
  
Chromecast audio, Raspberry Pi, Mopidy
Check out DC Bike Party on Facebook
Noted: lithium polymer batteries explode.

# John Kaufhold, [Deep Learning Analytics](http://www.deeplearninganalytics.com/)
_portable deep learning_
  
Jetson TK1
NVIDIA processor, 192 core graphics card.
Small device built -- case built for a project.
Learned that he can put it in a sandwich box. 
Deep learning device, mobile. Trying to get sensor data into deep learning data decisions.

# Travis Hoppe, [@metasemantic](https://twitter.com/metasemantic)
_Bro do you even science?_
  
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
char-rnn (Andrej Karpathy): Lua/torch library to implement RNN-LSTM
https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn

arXiv.org: downloaded everything because that's what Travis does ;)
Machine Learning: trained all categories on the same set of hyperparameters
Generated fake article titles: scientists couldn't figure out which were real!

# Merav Yuravlivker, [@merav_yurav](https://twitter.com/merav_yurav)
_bringing a static graph to life_
 
First hack and tell. :)
Suicide attacks in Paris, WaPo had a static visualization. Built a visualization using R and Shiny, bar charts and a choropleth.  

Raw data source from University of Chicago, [cpostdata](http://cpostdata.uchicago.edu/search_new.php).
