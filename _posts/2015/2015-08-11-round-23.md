The darknet 
Using Python and the Darknet to: 
1) Scrape websites in a distributed way (getting a new IP address each time to avoid IP bans)
2) Access control (circumvent IP range blocks)
3) Censorship detection: does the country of origin change what content you see?

**Data Lens**

Project/Blog lives at: www.datalensdc.com

New blog analyzing DC-related data sets
Recent post: Metro Delays for the first half of 2013-2015
Of course, delays are worse during rush hours than any other travel time
Data from WMATA, though they deny it!

First post: Looking at migration among cities -- how migratory is DC compared to other cities? Data comes from the US Census (American Community Survey)

What's next? Looking at the geographic evolution of nightlife in DC?

**Arduino LED board**

Shannon Turner, connecting an Arduino to an LED board
Shopping list and more to come at https://github.com/shannonturner/LED_board

At the Smithson American Art Museum
"Watch This"

Built a WORKING Adrunio board for the first time.  End result a scrolling marque 16x32 pixels, shows "I have been trying to do this since July 25th".  Bouncing circles in the background.

Bought a lot of things I didn't need for this project. Have a lot of leftover useless parts.
3.5V logic vs 5V logic is really important.

Can load C++ programs directly into the logic board and it will run w/o computer. $60 total cost.

Next step: giant table LED board!

# Speaker #7: [Jan Domanski]() 
**How to have lunch with Nobel prize winners* on a regular* basis**

"you pompous son-of-a-bitch" -- well deserved.
Oxford college, established 1264 -- many interesting people invited to lunch.

Senior common room opens invitations to the website on Friday night MIDNIGHT. Wrote a scrapper using mechanize a module in python. Provides login credentials etc... Put it on live AWS instance to beat the system even when the laptop was down.

# Speaker #8: [Jess Garson]()
**Zine: "What's my function"**

Wrote a zine, a self-published journal. "What's my function" a programming zine. This used to be a thing. Wanted it to be for beginners. Originally wanted to bring it to zine-fest. Old fashioned & old-school, cut and paste literally.

Lofty goals, brought it down to a simple content. Inspired by punk zines. 

Zines were created during the riot grrrl movement to talk about things that couldn't be talked about.
