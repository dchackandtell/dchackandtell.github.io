# Speaker #1: [Rachel Shorey]() 

Rachel Shorey, Girl Scouts mentions on the Congressional Record
Started with http://capitolwords.org/?terma=boy+scouts&termb=girl+scouts - but it didn't quite fit her needs.
Live Demo at http://www.scout-vs-scout.com
Code lives at https://github.com/rshorey/scout-vs-scout
Who appears in the congressional record more -- boy scouts or girl scouts?
Boy scouts appears 67 times / girl scouts appears 14 times.
If you want to see that change, it has a widget to contact your representative.

Maggie Criqui, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives
Live Demo at: http://ddd-and-yelp.mybluemix.net
Code lives at: https://github.com/mcriqui/Diners_DriveIns_and_Dives
Are the restaurants Guy Fieri goes to in Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives actually good? (According to Yelp)
List of restaurants was helpfully compiled on Wikipedia
Ran those through the Yelp API (lots of data cleaning required first)
Put everything into JSON and color coded the ratings

Jess Garson, Simple Pandas
Code lives at: https://github.com/JessicaGarson/Simple_Pandas
Inspired by: https://github.com/aliyarahman/code_that_only_does_one_thing
Pandas is a library for data cleaning, data wrangling, and analysis (the "R" of Python).
Short examples of common tasks in Pandas like merging two data files
The goal of all of this is to make it easier to find out how to do common tasks in Pandas and improve the learning experience for beginners

Elaine Ayo, Audiolyzer: Listen to your data (Hacking Journalism Hackathon project)
Code lives at: https://github.com/emmjab/audiolization
Live demo at: http://audiolyzr.pythonanywhere.com/test
Collaboration with Rowan, Emma, and Danny
How do you generate sound based on data?
Takes in a dataset, normalizes it onto a 0-1 scale and translates that into frequencies.
Used shark attack data and turned it into music!
Uses the tones.js library to generate the musical tones

Michael Kane, Wordswarm
Code lives at: https://github.com/thisIsMikeKane/WordSwarm
Dynamic word cloud visualization: how do these words change over time?
Used AAAS Science Magazine Google books n-gram and social security baby names.
Dynamically generated word cloud based on the most used words for that year
Data from 1980 - 2014
Created in PyGame; each word is a box in the physics emulator that does collision detection
Topics in AAAS Science Magazine over time
US President Popularity in Google nGrams over time
Baby name popularity over time
All written in Python and shell scripts: pre-processing, Wordswarm, and post-processing

Chris, PolTwt
Live demo at: alpha.poltwt.com
Pulls in top tweets from public figures, breaks out topics, mentions, and hashtags
Data is stored in memory tables -- not for long-term storage but great for very fast queries and queries with many joins
Not great for complex comparisons -- the performance boost isn't too much in those cases 
Built with Flask & Bootstrap


Shannon Turner, Let's Go!
Search over 6000 museums from all across the US.
Search by category or search by location
Live demo at: shannonvturner.com/museums
Code lives at: https://github.com/shannonturner/museums
Written in Django
Needed to create an Extract, Transform, and Load process to get data from the Institute of Museum & Library Sciences into working order
Data cleaning was a big problem: there were a lot of bad museums in the data
Fully responsive website!
