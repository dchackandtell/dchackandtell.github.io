Anti-ISIS Tweets
why is twitter important to fight ISL? 200,000 tweets per day! 
governments are poor against the fight
Satanic state / who is pro/anti ISIS?
Sentiment analysis tool to determine who  

Used tweepy (python) to determine which tweets /hashtags are pro/anti.
#daeshbag derogatory hashtag for ISIS

# Kajari
_TAGLINE_

Just started working in the real-word. Wanted to explore Unity.
Google cardboard, first-person movement through the city.

It works! 
Q: Can you put in Google city-view and create a real city to move around? 
A: Maybe! Goal is to do that, especially Dupont Circle, which is the landing page for the company she works for.

One day to learn Unity, one day for Google cardboard, day three to put it all together. It was surprisingly easy.

# Andrew Baker
_TAGLINE_

A voicemail app for people who really, really don't like receiving voicemails.
Repo: https://github.com/atbaker/anti-voicemail
Presentation: https://atbaker.me/Anti-Voicemail/index.html

side project, wanted to kill voicemail. First used google voice to translate into text. WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. Actively dissuade people to leave voicemail. Stop robomails.

Do it for free! Hosted on heroku. Uses conditional call forwarding. QR code, cause I'm the only one in the US that uses it. 

Code is well documented and well tested!
Now works on other carriers.

# Jouella Fabe
_TAGLINE_

Sentence builder
NLP libraries/Realizer engine
A Realizer generates english sentences (SimpleNLG, KPML, KUF/Surge, etc...) 
`john eat -> john likes to eat`
Sets up features, negative verbs etc. change tense etc
Built a demo http://macmania.github.io/simplenlg_frontend/
Deployed on Heroku.

Fails:
I shot the sheriff.
The sheriff had not been shot by me.

# Rushi Shah, [@2016rshah](https://twitter.com/2016rshah)
_TAGLINE_

Embed your github contributions calendar into HTML (or anywhere else) as an image: 

Repo: https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api
Get yours at: http://ghchart.rshah.org/<YOUR-USERNAME>

Rushi is a narcissistic person and wanted to embed his github contributions on other sites, because he has so much green contribution goodness. Deploy to a heroku server to dump out the image. Dropped ruby on rails and switched to Sinatra.

Color schemes!

# Brock Wilcox, [@awwaiid](https://twitter.com/awwaiid)
_TAGLINE_

White elephant gift selector. Rough idea prototype, show products for you to choose.
Wanted to make an API to select products. Used a scraper to pull out more results via pagination. Wrote it in reagent/clojure. 

Almost wrote in perl6 and realized it was a bad idea [that late at night -- perl6 rocks!] and went back to learning clojure. Thinking about adding prefetching, brackets via NCAA style for best gift ever!      
Repo: https://github.com/awwaiid/white-elephant
Will eventually be hosted somewhere :)
